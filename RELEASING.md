# Releasing

## Versioning
Testify has an automated release system and uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) version numbering system. Production release versions should conform semantic versioning scheme (i.e. 0.9.1) and development release version should conform semantic versioning scheme along with SNAPSHOT qualifier (i.e. 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT)

major.minor.patch

| number | meaning                                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| major  | major version, with most probably incompatible change in API and behavior  |
| minor  | minor version, important enough change to bump this number                 |
| patch  | a released build number incremented automatically a pull request is merged |
